# Implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to 
# one decimal place. Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:
# x is an integer; y is +, -, *, or /; z is an integer. For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0

exp = input("Expression: ")
x, y, z = exp.split(" ")
x = float(x)
z =float(z)
if y == '+':
    print(x + z)
elif y == '-':
    print(x - z)
elif y == '*':
    print(x * z)
elif y == '/':
    print(x / z)
else:
    print(x)
